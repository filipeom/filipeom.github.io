# Getting Started

To install rust, please, follow the official documentation.

- [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

You should, at least, have the rust compiler (i.e., `rustc`) installed.

# Managing Rust Projects with Cargo

## Cargo Overview

`cargo` is Rust's official build tool and package manager:

- Simplifies project management, dependency handling, and building.

Usage examples:

\small

```sh
cargo new my_project    # create a new project
cargo build             # build project
cargo build --profile realease # builds optimized binary
cargo run               # runs the project
cargo test              # runs tests
```

# Managing Rust Projects with Cargo

## Benefits of Cargo

Dependency Management and Build Automation:

- Automatically fetches and manages project dependencies.
- Handles compilation, linking, and building release artifacts.

Project Structure:

- Enforces a conventional project structure for consistency.

`rustc`: The Rust compiler.

- Can be used directly, but Cargo simplifies many tasks.

# Control Flow Constructs: If-statement

Rust provides flexible control flow constructs, including `if` statements,
`for`-loops and `while`-loops.

- The `if` statement syntax is straightforward:

```rust
let x = 5;
if x > 0 {
    println!("Positive!")
} else {
    println!("Non-positive")
}
```

# Control Flow Constructs: Loops

## While loop

```rust
while condition {
    // Code inside the loop
}
```

Example:

```rust
let mut n = 3;
while n > 0 {
    println!("Countdown: {}", n);
    n -= 1
}
```

# Control Flow Constructs: Loops

## For loop

```rust
for item in iterable {
    // Code to run for each item
}
```

Example:

```rust
let ns = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
for n in ns {
    println!("Number: {}", n);
}
```

# Ranges and Iterators

Rust has a powerful syntax to declare ranges over natural numbers:

- Write `0..n` to declare a range starting in $0$ to $n-1$, and
- Write `0..=n` to declare a range starting in $0$ to $n$

Example:

```rust
for n in 1..5 {
    // Code to run for each number in the range [1, 5[
}
for n in 1..=5 {
    // Code to run for each number in the range [1, 5]
}
```

# Ranges and Iterators

Inspired from functional languages Rust allows us to write concise code using
iterators. For example:

- One can obtain the sum of a vector by simply writing:

```rust
let ns = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sum: i32 = ns.iter().sum();
```

- Or, the squares of the previous vector with:

```rust
let squared = ns.iter().map(|x| x * x).collect();
```

Note that, `|x| x * x` represents a *lambda*/*closure*.

# Closures

A *lambda* is an anonymous function used to express single operations or
behaviours.

- In Rust, lambdas are called *closures*
- Closures are defined using the `|param| expr` syntax

In the previous example, `|x| x * x` is a closure that takes a single
parameter `x` and returns the square of `x` (i.e., `x * x`). Typically,
the use of closures is recommend in scenarios where a short, one-off
function is needed, and there's no need to define a separate function.

# Pattern Matching

Rust also has a powerful pattern matching construct:

```rust
match value {
    pattern1 => // Code for pattern1,
    pattern2 if condition => // Code for pattern2,
    _ => // Default code,
}
```

For example:

```rust
let result = match x {
    1 => "One",
    2 | 3 => "Two or Three",
    x if x < 0 => "Negative",
    _ => "Other",
};
```

# Option and Result

```rust
pub enum Option<T> {       pub enum Result<T, E> {
    None,                      Ok(T),
    Some(T),                   Err(E),
}                          }
```

[**Option**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html) and
[**Result**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html) are algebraic
data types (ADTs) in Rust, providing a concise and explicit approach to
managing potential missing values or errors in functions, thus eliminating
implicit exceptions. This forces developers to actively acknowledge and handle
these scenarios, promoting robust error management and contributing to enhanced
code clarity and safety.

# Option and Result

Examples:

```rust
let maybe_value: Option<i32> = Some(42);
let result: Result<i32, &str> = Ok(42);
// Unwrap value, if None returns the default the type
let value = maybe_value.unwrap_or_default();
// Multiply a valid result by 2
let result2 = result.map(|x| x * 2);
```

In Rust, it is recommend to use pattern matching to handle these types appropriately.

# Parsing Integers from Stdin

## Reading Input

Use `std::io::stdin()` to read input from the standard input:

```rust
let mut input = String::new();
std::io::stdin().read_line(&mut input)
    .expect("Failed to read line");
```

# Parsing Integer from Stdin

## Parsing Integers

Convert the input to a string using `parse`:

```rust
let parsed_num: Result<i32, _> = input.trim().parse();
match parsed_num {
    Ok(number) => // Use the parsed integer,
    Err(_) => // Handle parsing error,
}
```

# Reliably Parsing Various Integers

## Step 1

Create a helper function to parse integers from a string:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct ParserError(String);

fn usize(str: &str) -> Result<usize, ParserError> {
    str.trim()
        .parse::<usize>()
        .map_err(|e| ParserError(format!("{}", e)))
}
```

Note that, we don't handle the error directly, we simply propagate it
to the client using a special error `ParserError`.

# Reliably Parsing Various Integers

## Step 2

With a line from the stdin parse as many integers as you would like.
Here, we assume integers are separated by a white space.

\scriptsize
```rust
fn pair() -> Result<(usize, usize), ParserError> {
    let mut buffer = String::new();
    std::io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut buffer)
        .map_err(|e| ParserError(format!("{}", e)))?;
    let mut nums = buffer.split(" ");
    let fst = nums
        .next()
        .ok_or_else(|| ParserError(format!("fst")))
        .and_then(|s| usize(s))?;
    let snd = // same as above ...
    Ok((fst, snd))
}
```

# Error Propagation

## Try Operator

```rust
std::io::stdin()
    .read_line(&mut buffer)
    .map_err(|e| ParserError(format!("{}", e)))?; // <-
```
Note the special use of the `?` operator in the previous code. The `?`
operator in Rust streamlines error propagation. Used in functions returning
`Result`, it unwraps the value on `Ok` or short-circuits to return `ParserError`
early. This simplifies error handling, reducing the need for explicit `match`
or `unwrap` statements and contributing to concise, readable code.

# Ownership in Rust


In Rust, each value has a variable that is its "owner":

- Ownership of a value can be transferred from one variable to another
- The original variable can no longer be used

```rust
fn transfer_ownership(s: String) {
    // s is the owner of a String
    // Ownership transferred to this function
} // s goes out of scope, memory freed
let x = String::from("Hello");
// Ownership transferred to the function
transfer_ownership(x);
// println!("{}", x); // Error: x is no longer valid
```

# Borrowing in Rust -- Immutable Borrowing

Borrowing allows references to values without transferring ownership:

- References can be mutable or immutable
- Multiple references can borrow a value immutably:
    - No changes can be made

Example:

```rust
fn immutable_borrow(s: &String) {
    // s is an immutable reference to a String
}
let x = String::from("Hello");
immutable_borrow(&x); // Passing an immutable reference
```

# Borrowing in Rust -- Mutable Borrowing

Only one mutable reference is allowed at a time:

- Prevents data races

Example:

```rust
fn mutable_borrow(s: &mut String) {
    // s is a mutable reference to a String
}
let mut x = String::from("Hello");
mutable_borrow(&mut x); // Passing a mutable reference
```

# Heap Allocation in Rust

Rust allows dynamic allocation on the Heap. Ownership ensures memory safety
without GC.

- The `Box` type is used for heap allocating
- Boxes have a single owner

\small
```rust
fn heap_allocation() -> Box<Vec<i32>> {
    // Allocating a Vec<i32> on the heap and returning a Box
    Box::new(vec![1, 2, 3])
}
// Ownership transferred to the variable data
let data = heap_allocation();
```

# Heap Allocation in Rust -- Dropping and Cleaning

Ownership rules govern cleanup; no need for explicit deallocation:

- When a variable goes out of scope, its memory is automatically freed

```rust
{
    let data = Box::new(String::from("Heap Allocated"));
} // Memory is freed here
```

# Practical Example -- Parsing and Storing a Graph in the Heap

## Step 1 - Choose a Memory Layout

To first parse a directed graph, $G$, choose how you're going to represent it on
memory, for example, using a adjacency list:

```rust
struct Graph {
    v: usize,
    adj: Vec<Vec<usize>>,
    rev_adj: Vec<Vec<usize>>,
}
```

In this `struct` we store:

- `v`, the number of vertexes
- `adj`, the adjacency list of the directed graph $G$
- `rev_adj`, the reverse adjacency list of the graph, denoted $G^T$

# Practical Example -- Parsing and Storing a Graph in the Heap

## Step 2 - Parse the Graph from the Stdin

- Read the edges from stdin and store them in the adjacency list
- Return a reference to a heap allocated graph

\scriptsize
```rust
fn parse_graph() -> Result<Box<Graph>, ParserError> {
    let (v, mut e) = pair()?;
    let mut adj: Vec<Vec<usize>> = vec![vec![]; v];
    let mut rev_adj: Vec<Vec<usize>> = vec![vec![]; v];
    while e > 0 {
        let (u, w) = pair()?;
        assert!((u - 1) < v);
        assert!((w - 1) < v);
        adj[u - 1].push(w - 1);
        rev_adj[w - 1].push(u - 1);
        e = e - 1
    }
    Ok(Box::new(Graph { v, adj, rev_adj }))
}
```


# Practical Example -- Parsing and Storing a Graph in the Heap

## Step 3 - Entry point

The lifetime of the graph is only within its owner scope:

```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), ParserError> {
    // Parse the graph and obtain ownership
    let graph = parse_graph()?;

    // Perform operations with the graph
    // ...

    // Graph ownership goes out of scope, and
    // memory is automatically freed
    Ok(())
}
```

# Tips: Rust's Smart Referencing

Rust's implicit reference coercion automatically converts certain types to
references when needed, simplifying the use of owned values in contexts
requiring references and eliminating explicit conversion syntax.

\scriptsize

```rust
fn process_graph(g: &Graph) {
    // Automatically coerces Box<Graph> to &Graph when passed
}
fn main() -> Result<(), ParserError> {
    // Parse the graph and box it on the heap
    let boxed_graph: Box<Graph> = parse_graph()?;
    // Pass the boxed graph to a function expecting a reference
    process_graph(&boxed_graph); // Implicit reference coercion
    Ok(())
}
```

# Tips: Rust's Smart Dereference

Rust's smart dereference coercion simplifies the process of dereferencing,
automatically converting certain types to references when needed.
This eliminates the need for explicit dereferencing syntax.

\small

```rust
fn process_graph(g: &Graph) {
    // Automatically coerces &Graph to Graph when
    // dereferencing parameter v
    println!("Number of vertices: {}", g.v);
}
```

# Tips: Efficient Code with Asserts

Leveraging asserts at the top of a function can optimize code execution by
enabling the Rust compiler to eliminate runtime bounds checks when iterating
through a vector `data` using indices.

\small

```rust
fn process(data: &Vec<i32>, size: usize) {
    assert!(data.len() >= size);

    for i in 0..size {
        // Internal vector bounds checks can be
        // optimized away because of the assert invariant
        data[i] ...
    }
}
```
